# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the documentation for our PyTorch-based Movie Recommendation System. This documentation covers the implementation details, training process, and key concepts of our collaborative filtering model.

## Overview

Our recommendation system uses matrix factorization to learn:
- User preferences (as embedding vectors)
- Movie characteristics (as embedding vectors)
- User and movie biases

The model is implemented using PyTorch and trained on user-movie rating data.

## Key Features

- Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization
- PyTorch implementation
- Efficient batch processing
- Comprehensive training and validation
- User and movie embeddings

## Documentation Structure

1. **Model**
    - Overview of the recommendation system
    - Training process explanation
    - Understanding epochs
    - Understanding gradients

2. **Code**
    - Detailed model implementation
    - Data processing and cleaning

## Getting Started

To run the recommendation system:

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install torch pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# Run the model
python recommendation_model.py
```

The model will:
1. Load and preprocess the rating data
2. Train for 10 epochs
3. Display training progress
4. Save the trained model
